        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently in the second year and third semester of my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) program at 
                Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. 
                My primary academic focus revolves around information and communication technology (ICT) with a minor in 
                Computational Science (CS). This minor allows me to delve into various computational methods and their 
                real-world applications. I have a keen interest in both the theoretical and practical aspects of ICT and 
                am enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge and skills in these areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my studies, I have a keen interest in Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) and
                web development. I have recently startes exploring the world of web development and am
                enthusiastic about honing my skills in this area.
                One of my strengths lies in mathematics, and I find it intriguing to apply mathematical
                concepts to real-world problem-solving and programming challenges.
                Additionally, I am also drawn to competitive coding, and I am currently exploring this 
                domain to develop my coding and problem-solving abilities.
                Currently, residing in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, I am eager to learn and grow in the field of 
                ICT, leveraging my interests and skills to make meaningful contributions.
